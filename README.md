# 04-HW-Code-Quiz
Description:

For this assignment I started from scratch to build a quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as DOM elements. I was able to create quizs that appeared once start button was clicked, a timer that counted down once quiz was started and even subtracted time when incorrect answers were chosen. At the end of the quiz user is able to input their initials to go along with their score so that is saves. From there they can either clear the high scores or return to the beginning of the quiz.
